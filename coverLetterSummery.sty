My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated through my ongoing engagement with advanced coursework in Data Structures, React/Next.js, and Node.js, complemented by actively solving algorithmic challenges on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This foundation enables me to approach complex problems with both theoretical understanding and practical experience.

Beyond technical skills, I bring:
